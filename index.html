    <span>US fast-food chain McDonald's contributes nearly £400m to the West Country's economy every year, a new report has revealed. The study was commissioned by the restaurant to mark its 50th birthday in Britain.
        The first McDonald's opened in the UK in Woolwich, London, in October 1974. The business now operates around 1,435 restaurants across the country, including 102 in the South West.The ‘McDonald’s at 50’ report looks at the company's contribution to the UK’s cities, through jobs created in restaurants and the wider economic impact through its supply chain.
        According to the research, the chain's direct economic contribution across the South West of England last year totalled around £263m. When including the restaurant's supply chain, the figure rose to £394.6m.
        McDonald's employs 12,305 people in the West of England. Last year, the chain created more than 1,200 jobs in Bournemouth and more than 1,000 in Bristol. It also created hundreds of roles in cities including Swindon, Plymouth, Gloucester and Exeter.        
        McDonald’s franchisee Ralph Parker, who owns and operates 12 restaurants across the South West and Wales, said: “Creating and sustaining jobs across the South West is of huge importance to me, and the fact that we have been able to make a significant financial contribution to the area is something my team and I are very proud of."
        In addition to restaurant jobs, the South West is home to one of McDonald’s biggest dairy suppliers - Gloucester's Schreiber Foods. The restaurant chain said through partners such as Schreiber, it contributed a further £131.3m annually to the regional economy and 1,785 extra jobs.
